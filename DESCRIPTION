Description: Provides a set of functions for taking qualitative GIS data, hand drawn on a map, and 
   converting it to a simple features object. These tools are focused on data that are drawn on a map
   that contains some type of polygon features. For each area identified on the map, the id numbers
   of these polygons can be entered as vectors and transformed using qualmap.
