## Overview

This package implements a process for converting qualitative GIS data from an exercise where respondents are asked to identify salient locations on a map. This article focuses primarily on the use of the software to digitize these data. 

## Motivation and Approach

Qualitative GIS outputs are notoriously difficult to work with because individuals' conceptions of space can vary greatly from each other and from the realities of physical geography themselves. `qualmap` builds on a semi-structured approach to qualitative GIS data collection. Respondents use a specially designed basemap that allows them free reign to identify geographic features of interest and makes it easy to convert their annotations into digital map features. This is facilitated by including on the basemap a series of polygons, such as neighborhood boundaries or census geography, along with an identification number that can be used by `qualmap`. A circle drawn on the map can therefore be easily associated with the features that it touches or contains.

`qualmap` provides a suite of functions for entering, validating, and creating `sf` objects based on these hand drawn clusters and their associated identification numbers. Once the clusters have been created, they can be summarized and analyzed either within R or using another tool.

This approach provides an alternative to either unstructured qualitative GIS data, which are difficult to work with empirically, and to digitizing respondents' annotations as rasters, which require a sophisticated workflow. This semi-structured approach makes integrating qualitative GIS with existing census and administrative data simple and straightforward, which in turn allows these data to be used as measures in spatial statistical models.

More details on the package and how it fits into the broader ecosystem of qualitative GIS are available in a [pre-print on SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p9qn5/). All data associated with the pre-print are also available on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/pxzuc/), and the code are available via [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/pxzuc/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/PrenerLab/sketch_mapping/).

## Installation
The easiest way to get `qualmap` is to install it from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("qualmap")
```

You can install the development version of `qualmap` from [Github](https://github.com/chris-prener/qualmap) with the `remotes` package:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("chris-prener/qualmap")
```

Note that installations that require `sf` to be built from *source* will require additional software regardless of operating system. You should check the [`sf` package website](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for the latest details on installing dependencies for that package. Instructions vary significantly by operating system.

## Basics 
`qualmap` is built around a number of fundamental principles. The primary data objects created by `qm_combine()` are *long* data rather than *wide*. This is done to facilitate easy, consistent data management. The package also implements simple features objects using the `sf` package. This provides a modern interface for working with spatial data in `R`.

### Core Verbs
`qualmap` implements six core verbs for working with mental map data:

1. `qm_define()` - create a vector of feature id numbers that constitute a single "cluster"
2. `qm_validate()` - check feature id numbers against a reference data set to ensure that the values are valid
3. `qm_preview()` - plot cluster on an interactive map to ensure the feature ids have been entered correctly (the preview should match the map used as a data collection instrument)
4. `qm_create()` - create a single cluster object once the data have been validated and visually inspected
5. `qm_combine()` - combine multiple cluster objects together into a single tibble data object
6. `qm_summarize()` - summarize the combined data object based on a single qualitative construct to prepare for mapping

The order that these functions are listed here is the approximate order in which they should be utilized. Data should be defined, validated and previewed, and then cluster objects should be created, combined, and summarized.

### Main Arguments
All of the main functions except `qm_define()` and `qm_combine()` rely on two key arguments:

* `ref` - a reference object. This should be an `sf` object that contains a master list of features that appear in your study. This could a `sf` object representing all census tracts in a city or county, for example, or a tessellated grid covering the extent of a city.
* `key` - the name of geographic id variable in the `ref` object to match input values to. This could be a FIPS code, the `GEOID` variable in most census data, or the `OBJECTID` of a tessellated grid. Values entered into `qm_define()` should `key` values.

Additionally, a number of the initial functions have a third essential argument:

* `value` - the name of the cluster created using `qm_define()`

## Data Preparation
To begin, you will need a simple features object containing the polygons you will be matching respondents' data to. Census geography polygons can be downloaded via `tigris`, and other polygon shapefiles can be read into `R` using the `sf` package. 

Here is an example of preparing data downloaded via `tigris`:

```r
library(dplyr)   # data wrangling
library(sf)      # simple features objects
library(tigris)  # access census tiger/line data

stLouis <- tracts(state = "MO", county = 510)
stLouis <- st_as_sf(stLouis)
stLouis <- mutate(stLouis, TRACTCE = as.numeric(TRACTCE))
```

We download the census tract data for St. Louis, which come in `sp` format, using the `tracts()` function from `tigris`. We then use the `sf` package's `st_as_sf()` function to convert these data to a simple features object and convert the `TRACTCE` variable to numeric format.

If you want to use your own base data instead, you can use the `st_read()` function from `sf` to bring them into `R`.

## Data Entry
Once we have a reference data set constructed, we can begin entering the tract numbers that constitute a single circle on the map or "cluster". We use the `qm_define()` function to input these id numbers into a vector:

```r
cluster1 <- qm_define(118600, 119101, 119300)
```

We can then use the `qm_validate()` function to check each value in the vector and ensure that these values all match the `key` variable in the reference data:

```r
> qm_validate(ref = stLouis, key = TRACTCE, value = cluster1)
[1] TRUE
```

If `qm_validate()` returns a `TRUE` value, all data are matches. If it returns `FALSE`, at least one of the input values does not match any of the `key` variable values. In this case, our `key` is the `TRACTCE` variable in the `sf` object we created earlier.

Once the data are validated, we can preview them interactively using `qm_preview()`, which will show the features identified in the given vector in red on the map:

```r
qm_preview(ref = stLouis, key = TRACTCE, value = cluster1)
```

## Create Cluster Object
A cluster object is tibble data frame that is "tidy" - each feature in the reference data is a row. Cluster objects also contain metadata about the cluster itself: the respondent's identification number from the study, a cluster identification number, and a category that describes what the cluster represents. Clusters are created using `qm_create()`:

```r
> cluster1_obj <- qm_create(ref = stLouis, key = TRACTCE, value = cluster1, rid = 1, cid = 1, category = "positive")
> cluster1_obj
# A tibble: 3 x 5
    RID   CID CAT      TRACTCE COUNT
* <int> <int> <chr>      <dbl> <dbl>
1     1     1 positive  119300  1.00
2     1     1 positive  118600  1.00
3     1     1 positive  119101  1.00
```

## Combine and Summarize Multiple Clusters
Once several cluster objects have been created, they can be combined using `qm_combine()` to produce a tidy tibble formatted data object: 

```r
> clusters <- qm_combine(cluster1_obj, cluster2_obj, cluster3_obj)
> clusters
# A tibble: 9 x 5
    RID   CID CAT      TRACTCE COUNT
  <int> <int> <chr>      <dbl> <dbl>
1     1     1 positive  119300  1.00
2     1     1 positive  118600  1.00
3     1     1 positive  119101  1.00
4     1     2 positive  119300  1.00
5     1     2 positive  121200  1.00
6     1     2 positive  121100  1.00
7     1     3 negative  119300  1.00
8     1     3 negative  118600  1.00
9     1     3 negative  119101  1.00
```

Since the same census tract appears in multiple rows as part of different clusters, we need to summarize these data before we can map them. Part of `qualmap`'s opinionated approach revolves around clusters representing only one construct. When we summarize, therefore, we also subset our data so that they represent only one phenomenon. In the above example, there are both "positive" and "negative" clusters. We can use `qm_summarize()` to extract only the "positive" clusters and then summarize them so that we have one row per census tract:

```r
> pos <- qm_summarize(ref = stLouis, key = TRACTCE, clusters = clusters, 
+    category = "positive", geometry = TRUE, use.na = FALSE)

```

The `qm_summarize()` function has an options to return `NA` values instead of `0` values for features not included in any clusters (when `use.na = TRUE`), and can return a non-`sf` tibble of valid features instead of the `sf` object (when `geometry = FALSE`).

## Mapping Summarized Data
Finally, we can use the `geom_sf()` geom from [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) to map our summarized data, highlighting areas most discussed as being "positive" parts of St. Louis in our hypothetical study:

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = qualData, mapping = aes(fill = positive)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis()
```

Since `qualmap` output are `sf` objects, they will work with any of the spatial packages that also support `sf`.
